This is my graduation work!

It's a video store system based on Pentaho WCM data warehouse using MySQL to store full data and Apache Cassandra to get a fastest way to find all movies from some actor, using the NoSQL columnar-oriented database.

Also using JSF2.0, Hibernate (MySQL persistence) and Hector API (Cassandra Persistence).
